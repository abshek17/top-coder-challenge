I have a problem statmenet I need to find a solution for. 

The problem statement is described in PRD.md

Raw information is present in public_cases.json and Interviews.md

I've done an initial attempt at finding a solution and its logic is present in legacy calculate.py

I want to take a slightly different approach.

First I want you to clearly and thouroughly analyze the information from Figgue_1. This is a plot of all the 1000 example cases from the public_Cases.json files.

Based on that and the Raw information. I want you do thefollowing: 

1. Generate a list of important domensions/factors to consider in trying to establish a set of rules in computing the final result. 
2. Write down those dimensions/factors clearly and crisply but concisely in a file called Dimensions.txt.
3. Validate that the domensions/factors correlate with the plots fro the figure.
